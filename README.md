## Maintenance by Prof. NOTA Evergreen Standard

This repo is a **Live Artefact App**: the user-facing UX is intentionally frozen
(“MINT CLOSED”, no wallet prompts), while the codebase remains buildable and
production-safe on Vercel.

### Runtime

- Node: **24.x** (local + Vercel)
- Package manager: **Yarn** (lockfile: `yarn.lock`)
- Deploy target: **Vercel**

### Build System

- Next.js **16** App Router (Turbopack)
- Yarn **4.x** via `packageManager` + `.yarn/releases`

### Monthly Safe Updates (recommended)

Monthly is **monitor + verify**, not modernization.

1. Check what's outdated (report only):

   - `yarn up -i`

2. Security report (report only unless explicitly approved):

   - `yarn npm audit --severity moderate`

3. Verify build reproducibility:

   - `yarn build`

4. Verify production sanity:

   - Confirm “MINT CLOSED”
   - Confirm no wallet prompts / connect flows
   - Confirm no critical console errors

### Major Updates (quarterly / scheduled)

Major upgrades must be done **one at a time**, with a dedicated PR and full testing.
Artefact UX must remain unchanged.

Examples:

- Next.js / React major version upgrade
- Web3 stack upgrade (e.g., thirdweb major)
- Toolchain changes (Next.js or bundler shifts)
- Node major policy change

### Artefact UX Policy (Frozen)

- Minting must remain **disabled**
- Wallet connect must remain **disabled**
- Any functional change requires a versioned successor (new tag/release)

## Evergreen Notes

- `@types/node` is pinned to **24.x** to match the Node 24 runtime (Vercel).
- Yarn is **4.x**; use `yarn up -i` for update review and `yarn npm audit --severity moderate` for security checks.
- CI runs on Node **24.x** with Corepack-enabled Yarn.
- Live parity check (zim.endhonesa.com): **All green** — MINT CLOSED, no wallet prompts, no critical console errors.

## 📜 General Information

**PABRIK ROTI: Programmed Bread Factory for Web3 Distribution**  
_Developed and maintained by [Prof. NOTA Inc.](https://nota.endhonesa.com)_

---

### 🏗️ What is PABRIKROTI?

**PABRIKROTI** is a white label, multi-tenant, Web3-enabled application designed to create, display, and distribute tokenized digital assets—referred to as **Programmed Bread**. It supports NFTs (ERC-721/ERC-1155) and fungible tokens (ERC-20), integrating dynamic tenant configurations, visual claim interfaces, and cultural licensing through a fully modular and customizable framework.

PABRIKROTI operates as a **decentralized digital production space**, where each domain/subdomain (e.g., `pabrikroti.endhonesa.com`) loads unique configurations for its respective brand, campaign, or cultural project, while still using the same underlying platform.

---

### ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Tenant-Based Theming**  
  Auto-detects hostname, which is domain/subdomain and applies custom config from `/src/config/receipts/`.

- **NFT Explorer & Claim Interface**  
  Pages like `/free`, `/paid`, `/token/[idNFT]` list and handle claiming of tokenized assets with eligibility logic, fallback visuals, and blockchain status integration.

- **ERC-20 Token Claim Pages**  
  Pages like `/coins`, `/address/[coinAddress]` enable users to claim community or utility tokens with live metadata, eligibility checks, and claim buttons.

- **Flexible Front Page (Multi-Mode)**  
  Depending on the domain/subdomain, the home page renders:

  - **Mode `abc`**: Login gateway with featured tokens
  - **Mode `aiueo`**: Landing page for branding & storytelling

- **Web3-Ready & Mobile Optimized**  
  Built with:

  - Next.js 15 + App Router
  - React 19 + Server Components
  - Tailwind CSS v4
  - ThirdWeb SDK v5
  - Prof. NOTA Inc. Protocol

- **Ethical Licensing & Multilingual Manifestos**  
  Supports 6+ languages for license agreements and project manifestos. Access is granted only with permission from [Prof. NOTA & Prof. NOTA Inc.](https://nota.endhonesa.com/) or certified facilitators.
